# 2026 – Project Portfolio (Chen/Clarence Xie)

This repository is a portfolio of my 2026 projects. Some projects were built as part of a team codebase, so this repo focuses on **my contributions, documentation, and sample outputs** (where shareable).

## Projects
- **LLM nDCG** – Evaluation utilities for ranking quality (nDCG) across model outputs.
- **Auto Agenda** – Python automation that summarizes influencer data into a KPI matrix and exports a Word report (.docx).
- **Category Clean** – Data cleaning and category mapping utilities.
- **Search Engine** – Retrieval/ranking components and analysis from a search engine project.

## Note on reproducibility
Some projects may not run end-to-end because they depend on team-owned modules, private datasets, or internal configs that cannot be shared publicly. Each project folder includes:
- what I built
- expected inputs/outputs
- integration points (what would be needed to run in the full codebase)
